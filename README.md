# music-composer-classifier
Classifies classical pieces by composer using ML.

This project classifies classical piano compositions by composer (Bach, Beethoven, Chopin) using MIDI files from the MAESTRO dataset. It extracts interpretable musical features such as pitch histograms, rhythmic profiles, and interval transitions, and trains a Random Forest classifier to predict the composer. The dataset must be downloaded separately and placed in the project directory.
